= Implementation plan
:sectnums:

== Infrastructure
* logging
* runtime options via config file
* REST data model
* REST client
* history data model
* history gathering
* history loading and saving
* commandline options

== Basic game logic
* basic game cycle (random task choice, buying lives at every opportunity)
* history aggregation and display
* simple task selection. Selection function based on success probability (needs history analysis), task value and task expiration time
* simple item purchase logic (buy upgrades when lives are over a configurable threshold)
* using history figure out if and how dragon level affects tasks

== Advanced game logic
* task message decomposition
* amending history gathering and analysis based on message parts
* task selection logic based on configurable reputation strategy. This needs history analysis to understand how attempted/completed tasks influence reputation and if and how reputation influences tasks available.
* using saved history, figure out what the upgrades do
* if it makes sense add refined upgrade logic

== Finalising
* write build and usage instructions
